# Weather Info App

Description
-------------

<p>
You get weather estimates for your current location.
You should grant the location permission and the app gives you current weather values, hourly estimates for the day and daily estimates for whole week. <p>
This app gets all data from a free weather API "https://open-meteo.com".

There was an issue with OpenWeatherApi responses, so I chose this other free open API for weather.
